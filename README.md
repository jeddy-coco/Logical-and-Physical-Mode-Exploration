# 📦 Packet Tracer Physical Mode Activity

Welcome to the Cisco Packet Tracer Physical Mode Activity!  
This guide walks you through hands-on tasks simulating the setup and configuration of a small to medium-sized business network.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This activity focuses on:

1. Investigating the Packet Tracer Physical Mode interface  
2. Exploring devices in a branch office wiring closet  
3. Connecting end-user devices to networking equipment  
4. Installing and configuring a backup router  
5. Setting a device hostname through terminal access  
6. Exploring additional network locations

## 🧱 Activity Parts

### 🔧 Part 1: Investigate the Bottom Toolbar
- Learn about the icon toolbar in Physical Mode
- Understand categories like Network Devices, End Devices, and Connections (e.g., copper, fiber)

### 🧰 Part 2: Investigate Devices in a Wiring Closet
- Navigate to **Intercity > Seward > Branch Office**
- Examine the rack setup: router, switches (e.g., ALS2), and a wireless access point
- Observe which devices connect via wired vs wireless connections

### 🔌 Part 3: Connect End Devices
- Use **Copper Straight-Through** and **Console** cables to connect devices
- Link **PC_1** to the **ALS2 switch** and **Edge_Router** via appropriate ports
- Understand differences between Physical and Logical cable representations

### 🧱 Part 4: Install a Backup Router
- Drag and rack the **Backup_Router**
- Power it on and connect it to **Laptop_1** using a **USB Console cable**
- Learn about modern device access methods

### 🖥️ Part 5: Configure a Hostname
- Open a terminal on **Laptop_1** and access the router CLI
- Run commands to rename the router to `Edge_Router_Backup`
- Note the difference between **Display Name** and **Hostname** in Packet Tracer

### 🌐 Part 6: Explore the Rest of the Network
- Move around the simulation: check out the **Wellington Data Center**, **Teleworker Home**, etc.
- Switch between **Physical** and **Logical** modes using `Shift+P` and `Shift+L`

## 📚 Background / Scenario

This simulated network includes a pre-configured environment with various Cisco devices. You’ve been "hired" to explore, review, and complete configuration tasks.  
Even if you're unfamiliar with every concept, this is your chance to learn hands-on. Don’t be afraid to experiment — you can always restart the activity.

---

## 🔁 Mode Switching

- **Logical Mode** (`Shift+L`): View logical topology and configurations  
- **Physical Mode** (`Shift+P`): See physical setups and cable layouts  
> ⚠️ Note: Some activities may restrict access to one mode.

---

## 🧪 Tips

- Use **Check Results** to track your progress  
- Use **Inspect Front/Rear** or **zoom tools** to clearly view device ports  
- Explore the **Cable Pegboard** to identify real-world cable types and their virtual equivalents
